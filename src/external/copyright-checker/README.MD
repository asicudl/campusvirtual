# Copyright Checker

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/692bfd6cdc6649e589adf8e1bc298b45)](https://app.codacy.com/app/mpellicer/copyright-checker?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=mpellicer/copyright-checker&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

The copyright checker allows users to declare the copyright status of the different resources uploaded to Sakai. Know the copyright status of all the resources is very important for the institutions to negotiate with the IP entities.

Every time an instructor uploads a file, the instructor will be informed via mail/notification that should declare the copyright status of the item, if the instructor doesn't declare the status after some period, the content will be hidden for regular users.

This tool allows the IP entities to make reports about the copyright status of the resources.

## Job to hide files that have not been declared

You may need to add a new job in the jobscheduler tool to your admin workspace.
-  In the jobscheduler tool click on "new job"
-  Select "Copyright Checker - Hide files which intellectual property has not been declared." from the dropdown list
-  Give it a name in the text box (can be anything)
-  Click post
-  Select the triggers link next to the job you just created
-  Create a new trigger. We suggest you set the job to run every 24 hours, which can be done with the following definition
```
0 0 * * * ?
```

## Debugging
Debugging, really useful to debug the entire process

```
log.config.count = 4
log.config.1 = DEBUG.org.sakaiproject.s2u.copyright.listener.ContentEventProcessor
log.config.2 = DEBUG.org.sakaiproject.s2u.copyright.logic.CopyrightCheckerServiceImpl
log.config.3 = DEBUG.org.sakaiproject.s2u.copyright.dao.impl.CopyrightCheckerDaoImpl
log.config.4 = DEBUG.org.sakaiproject.s2u.copyright.logic.SakaiProxyImpl
```
